# 💫 About Me:
I’m a Computer Engineering student and full-stack developer who enjoys building scalable, production-grade systems across backend, ML, and data engineering. I’ve worked on projects ranging from distributed systems and system design (Kafka-like broker, URL shortener) to ML-powered recommendation engines and big-data analytics with PySpark.<br><br>I’m currently focused on designing high-performance backend services, data pipelines, and ML-driven applications, while sharpening my skills in system architecture, APIs, and distributed computing. I enjoy turning complex problems into clean, reliable solutions that scale in real-world conditions.<br><br>I’m looking to collaborate on backend, ML, data engineering, or full-stack projects, especially those involving scalability, performance, or real-time systems. I’m always happy to help with system design, Python, C++, React, ML basics, or project structuring.<br><br>I’m currently learning more about distributed systems internals, large-scale data processing, and production ML workflows.<br><br>⚡ Fun fact: I like reverse-engineering real-world systems and rebuilding simplified versions to understand how they scale and fail in production.
